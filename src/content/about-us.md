title: I’m Ricardo Boraure, I’m deeply in love with Web Development
description: >-
  I’m a software developer based on Dominican Republic, born in Venezuela, I’m
  focused on frontend development, a self-taught learner, with a huge passion
  for delivering smooth and useful websites, I’m so happy for giving web users
  the best experience they can have.


  I have a passion for Frontend technologies like **React, Nextjs, Javascript**, and **JamStack** ecosystem, for example, **headless CMS**. I love to find useful solutions and discover new technologies. I enjoy sharing my knowledge and have feedback about code and solutions.


  I care about my manners and how I communicate my thoughts to my colleagues. I’m also a cooperative teammate, that looks for team improvement in order to get the best result we can achieve.
