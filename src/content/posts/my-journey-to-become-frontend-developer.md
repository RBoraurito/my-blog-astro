  My journey began in my last 3 years of high school, studying Pascal, Visual
  Basic, MySQL, a bit of Java, and some other hardware-related stuff, it wasn’t
  until the last year that I learn a little bit of PHP and Javascript(NodeJS),
  but not too much just context to know that those things exist, unfortunately,
  I didn’t take advantage of that opportunity to learn about modern web
  development, nowadays I understand the value of those classes.


  A couple of years after high school I discover [Platzi](https://platzi.com/r/ricardo-boraure), and decided to pay the yearly subscription and started learning web development. I begin with a lot of ideas, thinking about learning WordPress, PHP, and web fundamentals, but with no idea about what I really need to learn and in which order. I started studying HTML, CSS, and basics of javascript(just basics), I have to say that I didn’t go deep on fundamentals which is a huge mistake(later I’ll be explaining what I think were my mistakes on my journey), then I jump on PHP, but back then the basic course of PHP at Platzi was kind of hard to understand for a beginner, so I was so hard to understand some concepts that nowadays I think that are so simple.


  In those days I thought that I liked Backend and PHP, so I keep learning PHP, then WordPress to create a few websites with things like Theme builders and Visual editors(those tools aren’t bad or anything like that, it’s just I needed to go deep on programming), then I was looking for a way to create apps with PHP in an easier way, so I discover Laravel and to be honest it was one of the greatest feelings that I had in my developer experience because I just know the complexity of making a PHP app from scratch with some third party packages, but Laravel makes everything so easy and intuitive that I was surprised about it.


  Suddenly I realized that I´ve watched a lot of courses, but because of lack of practice I didn’t know anything really valuable in order to build a website due my lack in fundamentals, so I decided to stop learning PHP and get back to HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Git was kind of easy to review, but when I get to Javascript I noticed that I just know some basic stuff, so I learned things like asynchronism, clojure, scope, ES6+, hoisting, dom manipulation, V8 engine, NodeJS, NPM, etc. Then I started thinking that I had a clear path to becoming a good Web Developer.


  Then I discovered that learning JS Frameworks(React, Vue.js, and Angular) is a good next step for a Web developer, at this time I forgot learning PHP, Laravel, and WordPress, at this time by a friend of mine recommendation I choose Vue.js. When I knew the potential of that framework I felt like when I discovered Laravel, so I spend so many hours learning Vue and building side projects for learning purposes.


  The previous story summarises my journey learning Frontend before getting my first job, which was at [Habitat Web](https://habitatweb.mx/) as a Web developer working mostly working with PHP, WordPress, and Vue.js. Now I would like to share my personal suggestions in order to be more effective to become a Frontend Developer.


  * Learn how do internet and the Browser work.

  * Focus on Web Fundamentals HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

  * Take your time to build a clear path in order to get a job or to be able to build a professional website.

  * Pick a set of abilities and focus on them, if you learn something outside that set is cool, but always remember the set you pick.

  * Look at the job marketplace in order to get desired skills for getting a job.


  [Here](https://roadmap.sh/) is a cool website where you can find a good roadmap for building your own path, however, I suggest you to fit it to your likes and personal case.
