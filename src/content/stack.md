title: Technologies that I like to use day by day, and in side projects.
description: I want to share with you the tools that I use, and why I use them.
  In order to help you understand the impact o those technologies and tooling
  I’ll be explaning you how they help me when I code.
sections:
  - tech:
      - title: HTML
        description: This Markup language helps me declare the information of my
          Website/Web app, learning modern features helps declare that info
          properly, which helps to improve your accessibility, SEO, and also in
          some cases helps with base styling(if you don’t reset your styles).
          Nowadays you have a lot of tags that help you to show the user the
          information in the right way.
        link: ""
      - title: CSS
        description: As you know this is the language used to give style to our HTML,
          knowing the newest features of this language helps you make your work
          less complicated if you learn things like CSS vars, scroll snap,
          accent color, etc. And also knowing future possible features like [CSS
          nesting](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-nesting-1/), help you make
          decisions about which tools use or don’t use the native features when
          it’s possible.
        link: ""
      - title: Javascript
        description: The programming part in Frontend, this language is useful in
          Frontend and Backend, part of learning Javascript is learning how the
          browser works and how the internet works, for example, for fetching
          data, using browser information like preferred language, local
          storage, but also is important to learn how the language works
          internally, things like hoisting, event bubbling, scope, asynchronism,
          etc. But keep in mind that all of these things are fun to learn.

    title: Frontend Fundamentals
  - title: UI Library/Framework
    tech:
      - title: React
        link: https://beta.reactjs.org/
        description: In my opinion, the most popular UI Library, this library helps me
          build the Frontend. The interesting part of this library it’s
          closeness to Javascript and a great community. The great community is
          a strong point for using it because you can find help in almost all
          scenarios and a library for solving a problem. Another strong point is
          the attention that the developer team put on maintain and innovationg
          with features like SSR or Server Components
      - title: Vue.js
        link: https://vuejs.org/
        description: This Progresive Framework offers a routing, store managament
          system, and SSR, such as other tooling, like bundlers(Vite) and CLI,
          nowadays we have its third version wich move from its Options API to a
          Composition API(in my opinion has a huge inspiration from React), this
          Framework has a great community too, but smaller than React. A good
          point is that most developers that try Vue get like using it.
  - title: Meta Frameworks
    tech:
      - title: Next.js
        link: https://nextjs.org/
        description: This Framework without a doubt is most famous in React Community,
          Nextjs help you build a complete SEO ready Website/Web app with
          techniques like SSR, SSG, and ISR, it also has other amazing features
          like file routing, image optimization, fonts optimization, etc. In my
          opinion, the coolest thing about this Framework is that the developer
          team is from Vercel [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and has a close
          relationship with the React developer team which helps them keep the
          Framework updated with the last features of React. When I use this
          framework I enjoy having all these new features of React, blazing fast
          bundling, a good folder structure by default, a good Typescript
          support, and the way it helps me make faster the development process.
      - title: Remix
        link: https://remix.run/
        description: "This is a new SSR Framework for React, founded and maintained by
          the creators of React Router, this framework embraced these aspects:
          Web standards, Server/Client model, and Progressive enhancement. My
          experience working with this framework is so great, I enjoy too much
          working with it, I don’t have to think too much about how when trying
          to revalidate data, send or get data from the server, and create
          loading or error states in my pages or components."
      - title: Nuxt.js
        link: https://nuxtjs.org/
        description: It is the most popular Vue.js Meta Framework, it is like Next.js,
          but for Vue, now it has it’s V3 adding some updates like ISR,
          Hybrid(SSG/SSR/ISR), Composition API, better TS support, etc. I think
          Nuxt is the main option you have when you are looking for a complete
          Vue development environment.
  - title: Tooling
    tech:
      - title: Typescript
        link: https://www.typescriptlang.org/
        description: "**The Javascript superset**, I don’t have to explain too much why
          it’s an almost mandatory tool for any Javascript developer, it helps
          you with static typing checks which is such a great thing, because you
          can avoid common mistakes like sending wrong parameters to a function,
          accessing to a missing prop in an object, getting a property from null
          or undefined. You also have great IntelliSense support in code editors
          like VSCode."
      - title: Tailwind
        link: https://tailwindcss.com/
        description: A delightful CSS Framework, it feels like writing CSS but faster,
          it is flexible, themeable, easy to learn, good by default config, and
          lightweight, helping you with small and big projects. This framework
          it’s getting so much popularity due to the dev experience and
          performance on projects.
